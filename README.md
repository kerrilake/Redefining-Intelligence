# üß† Unspeciated: Research Explorer

**Discovering Intelligence Through the Perceive ‚Ä¢ Relate ‚Ä¢ Apply Framework**

*Exploring consciousness and relational intelligence across all life forms with wonder and wisdom*

## üåü Project Vision

This web application challenges anthropocentric definitions of intelligence by revealing the profound wisdom flowing through all life forms. Rather than comparing every species to human cognition, we explore intelligence as an **interbeing expression of life** where each species contributes unique gifts to planetary consciousness.

## üî¨ The Framework: Perceive ‚Ä¢ Relate ‚Ä¢ Apply

Based on Kerri Lake's groundbreaking research, this framework offers a universal lens for understanding intelligence across species:

- **Perceive**: How life forms sense and become aware of information
- **Relate**: How they connect and communicate with their environment  
- **Apply**: How they use awareness to act and contribute to life

This approach dissolves the artificial separation between human and non-human intelligence, revealing consciousness as a collaborative phenomenon rather than competitive hierarchy.
